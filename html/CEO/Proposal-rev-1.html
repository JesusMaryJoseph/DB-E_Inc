    <label class="proposal-label">II) Proposal:</label>
    <ol type="A"> 
        <li>Form a Company that will:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Simulate Commodore, Apple and Radio Shack</li>
                <li>Design and Build an 8-bit Computer from the 74LS__ series of Integrated Circuits(ICs).</li> 
                <li>NOTE: This predates 1975 so this 8-bit Computer will not have the capabilities
                of say the Apple II, TRS-80, or PET; however, the fundamental operations of the computer will be very similar.</li>
