    <label>II. Proposal:</label>
    <ol type="A"> 
        <li>Form a Company that will:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Simulate Commodore, Apple and Radio Shack</li>
                <li>Design and Build an 8-bit Computer from the 74LS__ series of Integrated Circuits(ICs).</li> 
                <li>NOTE: This predates 1975 so this 8-bit Computer will not have the capabilities
                of the Apple II, TRS-80, or PET; however, the fundamental operations of the computer will be very similar.</li>

        <li>Who:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>For Summer of 2025
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Six Students from Chesterton Academy High School in Albuquerque, NM</li>           
                    </ol>

                        <li>Six Students from Chesterton Academy High Schools not located in Albuquerque, NM</li>
                        <li>I like this option. It would be a nice connection between the Chesterton Academy Schools</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>For Summer of 2027 and successive summers

                        <li>Six Students from either Red Cloud High School or Pine Ridge High School located in Pine Ridge, SD</li>
                        <li>Without a doubt this is where my heart is! It would be a beautiful exercise in reconcillation
                            between Native and Non-Native Americans. It would help, especially the Native Americans, regain something they lost when they were forced on the Reservation: 'A good work ethic'.

                <li>For 2025, Queen of Heaven Parish, Albuquerque, NM</li>
                <li>For 2026, 2027 . . . . Cheyenne River Youth Project, Eagle Butte, SD</li>
                <li>Another option would be to rotate between NM and SD, which would require housing of the Native Americans here in Albuquerque. 
                    One of the advantages would be to help the Native Americans in adjusting to a life outside the Reservation.</li>

                                    Only when everyone is at wits' end can they ask for assistance from the 'Consultant Group'.
